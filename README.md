## Task Description

Analyzing Twitter tweets' attitude toward a specific entity is the aim of this work. Sorting each message's attitude into one of three categories—Positive, Negative, or Neutral—is the work at hand. Neutral messages are those that don't pertain to the designated entity. This will help us to learn more about how the Twitter community feels and expresses opinions on specific entities by carrying out this sentiment analysis.
